1. ✅ Google Account

    You'll need a Gmail account to access Firebase.

    If you're part of a team, use a shared Google account or create a dedicated one.

🏗️ Step-by-Step: Create Firebase Project & Deploy It
Step 1: Go to Firebase Console

👉 https://console.firebase.google.com/
Step 2: Create a New Project

    Click “Add Project”

    Give your project a name (e.g., ultrasonic-iot)

    Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (optional for IoT)

    Click Create Project

Step 3: Set Up Realtime Database

    In the left sidebar → go to Build > Realtime Database

    Click “Create Database”

    Choose the location (stick to the default)

    Select Start in test mode (you can secure later)

    Click Enable

🟡 This creates your Firebase Realtime Database with a URL like:

https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/

Step 4: Get Firebase Database Secret

    Go to Project Settings → Service accounts

    Scroll down and click “Database Secrets”

    Copy the secret token — this is needed for ESP8266 code

    📌 Firebase is deprecating secrets for production use. Use admin SDK tokens or rules for secure projects later.

Step 5: Set Firebase Rules (Optional for Testing)

In Realtime Database → “Rules” tab:

{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
Deploy a Web App (Optional for Dashboard)

You can create and host a web app dashboard that reads from Firebase:
Requirements:

    Install Node.js

    Install Firebase CLI:

npm install -g firebase-tools

Deploy Web App:

firebase login
firebase init hosting
# Choose your Firebase project
# Set public directory to: dist or build
# Configure as SPA: yes
firebase deploy

You’ll get a public URL like:

https://your-project-id.web.app/
