# IOTApp

Smart IoT System with Agentic AI + Arduino + Firebase + Web/Mobile
1.	Scope:
a.	Business: Smart environment monitoring
b.	Application: Python apps, Firebase backend, Web/Mobile dashboards
c.	Data: Sensor readings, AI insights, user interactions
2.	Key Stakeholders:
a.	Developer: Prabhu,Krishna,Arun,Prem
b.	Users: Farmers,homeowners,environment monitors
c.	Future engineers:  Those extending System later
3.	Principles:
a.	Modularity: Each sensor/component works independently
b.	Simplicity: Use low cost and simple tech
c.	Reusablity: Code and architecture should be adaptable
d.	DataSecurity: Secure Access to Firebase and GenAI API
e.	OpenStandards: HTTP,REST,JSON
4.	Tools:
a.	Modelling: Digrams.net
b.	VersionControl: Github
c.	Code: Python, Arduino IDE,JS,firebase SDK
d.	AIAgent: OpenAI
5.	Constraints and Assumptions
Type	Examples
Budget	Limited, so use free Firebase tier & ESP8266
Power	ESP8266 has limited processing power (no GenAI onboard)
Connectivity	Assumes stable Wi-Fi
Data Volume	Light â€” only sending small sensor data
Security	Firebase rules must be configured
